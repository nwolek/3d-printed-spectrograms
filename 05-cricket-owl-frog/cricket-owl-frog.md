## Description

The fifth model was based on a short field recording that we had used throughout the design process. Recorded overnight inside the Canaveral National Seashore on 21 May 2020, it features crickets, an owl, and a frog, all within the span of 30 seconds. The differences in the pitch, timbre, and pattern of these sound events make the recording a good spectrogram for application toward the end of the lesson. The cricket stridulations have an overlapping pattern that merges together into a band at the highest pitch among the three sound events, forming two ridges near the top of the spectrogram. The owl has the lowest pitch, with its sound event captured in three peaks near the left corner of the foreground. Because the speed of the owl's vocalizations increases, the middle peak is clearly closer to the last that the first. The frog vocalizations have a pitch that is between the owl and the cricket sound events and sit in the right half of the spectrogram. Because these frog vocalizations have a regular pattern and a timbre that is noisier than a single pitch, they form a series of vertical ridges about 4 cm long. Finally, because this is an acoustic recording instead of synthesized source, the extra noise gives the spectrogram's background a bumpy texture that was missing from the other models.
