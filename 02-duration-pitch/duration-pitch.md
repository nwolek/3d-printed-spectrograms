## Description

The second model concentrates on duration and pitch. The sine oscillator is used here to articulate a single rhythmic pattern three times, with each rhythmic group repeating the same short-medium-long pattern. The first peak in the pattern is about the diameter of a toothpick. This is followed by a second peak that is about a half centimeter wide and then a third peak that is just less than two centimeters wide. Each group articulates this pattern on a single pitch. The lowest pitch is found in the left corner of the foreground, with the next two iterations of the pattern increasing two octaves from the previous one. This results in three discontinuous horizontal ridges that gradually get farther from the foreground. Because the frequency scaling of the spectrogram is linear and these changes in pitch are exponential, the distance from the foreground is noticeably different for the final group. When this model is used while listening to the two-octave changes in the source recording, it can provide a tangible demonstration of how octaves are not linear.
