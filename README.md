A set of spectrograms designed to teach about common features of sound events (duration, intensity, pitch, timbre, pattern, speed). The digital files are provided so that anyone can 3D print these models for their own teaching or projects.

## Background



## How to Download

If you are not familiar with git, it is probably easiest to simply [download the latest version here](https://github.com/nwolek/3d-printed-spectrograms/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). 

If you are a more experienced git user who would like to take advantage of its features, you can easily download these to your desktop using something like following terminal commands:

```
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/nwolek/3d-printed-spectrograms.git
```

## How to Use

Each spectrogram model in this collection has been given its own folder. To enable 3D printing these spectrogram models by anyone (and provide some additional context), each folder contains the following digital files:

- [STL file](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000504.shtml) - Description of the spectrogram object for 3D printing. This is an open format that can be easily loaded into programs like [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura) or [MakerBot Print](https://www.makerbot.com/3d-printers/apps/makerbot-print/).
- [WAV file](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000001.shtml) - Sound recording used to generate the spectrogram. This uncompressed audio can also be used to hear the sound associated with each model while teaching.
- [PNG file](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000153.shtml) - Photo that documents what the the printed spectrogram should look like. This image provides a visual reference.
- [MD file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) - Descriptive text of the finished model and how its key features connect to the sound recording. This text provides a verbal reference.
