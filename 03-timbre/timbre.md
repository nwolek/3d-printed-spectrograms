## Description

The third model is designed to focus on timbre and demonstrate differences between tonal or noisy sound events. It does this by cross-fading between a sine wave oscillator and white noise generator. Because of its low pitch, the sine wave oscillator forms a thin, smooth, horizontal ridge near the front of the spectrogram. This contrasts easily with the wide, bumpy, vertical ridges created by the white noise fading in and then out. The bumpy texture of the white noise provides a clear contrast with the flat background of the digital silence in this spectrogram and the smooth shapes found in the other models. Although they sound perceptually about the same intensity, the sine wave's horizontal ridge is almost twice as tall as the white noise's vertical ridge. This feature helps to demonstrate that more focused pitches need to be more intense to balance with broadband noise. Because the sine wave fades out before the first white noise entrance and fades back in as it exits, there is a gap in its ridge. This contrasts with the second entrance of the white noise where the sine wave persists, causing the taller, pitched, horizontal ridge to seemingly slice through the shorter, noisy, vertical ridge.
