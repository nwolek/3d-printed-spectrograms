## Description

The fourth model demonstrates changes in both speed and patterns. The sine wave oscillator is used again to create brief sound events that individually form peaks on the model similar to the shape of a toothpick, and together these successive events form a horizontal line near the front of the model. The events have a pitch pattern that alternates between tones that are a half step apart, repeating a high-low-high pattern that is often used in demonstrations of auditory scene analysis. The distance between pitches is not enough to create vertical space between events, but it does create a subtle wobble when running fingers horizontally across the line of events. The speed of their repetition begins slow, increases to its fastest pace at the mid-point of the model, then decelerates back to their original pace before the end. This change in their pacing creates gaps between events at the left and right extremes of the line, but the peaks in the middle are so close together that they essentially fuse together. The rhythmic pattern was designed to be irregular, something that makes the gaps irregular where they are present. This contrasts with the regular pitch pattern heard in the model, as well as a contrast with the more regular rhythmic patterns in models one and two.
